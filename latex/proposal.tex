\section{Project Objectives}
We aim to develop a state estimation and localization algorithm for a mobile snake robot (shown in Figure \ref{fig:snake_robot}) operating in an environment with known terrain. Specifically, our objective is to estimate the robot's 3D pose and the configuration of its joints. This algorithm will be tested and evaluated in simulation, using a 3D model and physics engine to replicate the robot's real world behavior. The robot will be equipped with a six DoF IMU (three axis accelerometer and three axis gyroscope) and a contact/force sensor attached to each link, as well as an absolute rotary encoder attached to each joint. A terrain map will be used to provide information about the environment. Several different state estimation algorithms will be implemented, and each one will be evaluated based on its accuracy and robustness to sensor noise and drift.

\end{figure}

\section{Technical Approach}

The snake robot's orientation and joint configuration will be estimated separately from its position. An EKF will be used to estimate orientation and joint configuration, with a formulation similar to those in \cite{c1} and \cite{c2}. In addition to orientation and joint angles, serpentine gait parameters will be included in the state vector in order to simplify modeling of the robot's kinematics. Angular velocity commands for each joint will be used in the prediction step, while IMU and encoder measurements will be used in the correction step. 

Instead of attaching the body frame to a single link of the snake robot, a virtual body frame is defined at the center of mass and aligned to the principal moments of inertia of the snake. This helps to separate the configuration of individual joints from the overall orientation of the robot.

A particle filter will be used to estimate the 3D position of the robot relative to an inertial map frame. Estimated gait parameters from the EKF will be used to propagate each particle forward, and predicted contact forces will be compared to the measured forces in order to weight the particles in the correction step.  
These predicted contact forces will be computed by projecting a model of the snake robot into the terrain map, using the particles' position estimates and the orientation estimate from the EKF.

\section{Novelty}
While this project is built off of the work from \cite{c1} and \cite{c2}, we will provide the following novel contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimation of the full 3D pose of the snake rather than just the 3D orientation.
    \item Use of a terrain map to provide correction information for snake positioning.
    \item Use and evaluation of particle filtering for snake robot state estimation.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Milestones and Work Distribution}
Table \ref{tab:milestones} lays out our projected timeline. While everyone plans to take part in most implementation steps, each major component will have a team member in charge.

\section{Expected Outcomes}
Once our work is complete, we aim to have the following deliverables:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Simulator that can load a terrain map and simulate the physics of a snake robot moving within it.
    \item Implementation of an algorithm to estimate the 3D pose of the snake.
    \item Analysis of our algorithm's performance vs. simulator ground truth.
\end{enumerate}
